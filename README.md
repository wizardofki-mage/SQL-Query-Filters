## General Info
This is my SQL Portfolio Activity for the Coursera/Google Cybersecurity Certificate that I'm pursuing. It utilizes Coursera/Google's fictional Chinook database to perform queries with filters on tables therein using the open-source MariaDB.

## Author
- Jason Ash, Computer Science Major

## Technologies
I created this SQL Portfolio Activity in LibreOffice and saved it as a PDF so that it is more WYSIWYG for viewers. It can be viewed in any Web browser that can view PDF files or in Adobe Acrobat Reader.

## Explaination
- I wrote the Project description section based on my notes from the SQL course module that is part of this certification.
- The Scenario Information was copied from the assignment instructions.
- Under each query section heading, the first paragraph explaining the sub-scenario is taken from the assignment instructions.
- I wrote the explanation of how the SQL code works and the SQL code that follows my explanation.
- Then, screenshots showing my SQL query and the results are shown in each query section.
- I wrote the summary based on the assignment tasks accomplished within the portfolio.
